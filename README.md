<h1> Keep My Word </h1>
<br>
<p>Keep my word is a project thought to help you remind those words in other languages that you don't use often so you can't forget them.
Basically this is going to work like a dictionary, a personal one, where you can save the word with its meaning.</p>
<br>
<p>
With this project you will be able to save words with its meaning, as we mentioned before, but there will be also some other features like saving grammar rules and a notebook.
To save your words, you have to sign up.
</p>
<p>
The site will be responsive so you can access to your words in your mobile device.

<p>
This project may look easy, but the purpose of creating this is help you in your process of learning a new language and give you a tool to keep with you your words.
